# Route Optimization for Event Logistics

This project uses advanced data structures and algorithms to determine the quickest route through various stops, considering both road and air travel constraints.

- Data Structures Used 

The data structures used in this project include Graph, Queue, Array, and Linked List. 

 -Graph Traversal Algorithm

It employs Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path, efficiently handling air routes (24 hours) and road routes (4 hours). 


These structures work together to represent the cities and routes, manage the BFS algorithm, track visited nodes and distances, and efficiently handle the routes of each city. 

This algorithm allows for accurate time calculation, determining if deliveries can be made within specified time constraints. It facilitates efficient route planning, saving time and resources. The robust input validation ensures error-free handling, resulting in reliable outcomes.
